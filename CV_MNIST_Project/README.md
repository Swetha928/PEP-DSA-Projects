# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST)

## Problem Statement
This project aims to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

## Preprocessing
The images were normalized and reshaped to make them suitable for CNN input.

## Model
A CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers was used.

## Result
The model achieved a test accuracy of 99%.

## Conclusion
The CNN successfully learned spatial features from handwritten digit images and demonstrated high accuracy, showing the effectiveness of deep learning for image classification tasks.
